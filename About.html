      <p>
        he National Gallery of Art was conceived and given to the people of the
        United States by Andrew W. Mellon, a financier and art collector who
        served as secretary of the treasury under four presidents from 1921 to
        1932. During his years as a public servant, Mellon came to believe that
        the United States should have a world-class national art museum
        comparable to those of other nations. In 1936 Mellon wrote to President
        Franklin D. Roosevelt to offer his gift of paintings and sculpture for a
        new museum in Washington, DC, that he would build and finance with his
        own funds. Roosevelt endorsed Mellon’s offer, and Congress accepted his
        gift in 1937.
